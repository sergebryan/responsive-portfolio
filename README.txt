Responsive Portfolio

I created 3 pages: `index.html`, `portfolio.html`, `contact.html`.
I started working on the `index.html` page by creating my header. Then I pasted my header to other 2 pages (`portfolio.html`, `contact.html`) so they can look the same.

In my index.html page, I created a div that include class "logo", and a class showing elements (About, Portfolio and Contact).
Then I created a container that included class row with col-md-12. Inside the col, I put a bootstrap image with text. Finally I created footer page.

In the portfolio.html page, I created a container with a row and 6 cols to insert images using bootstrap image link and modified it for my need.

In my contact.html page, I created a container that include bootstrap form link showing userName, userEmail and message box to type text, and a submit button.
